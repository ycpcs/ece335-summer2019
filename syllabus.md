Required Textbook
-----------------

Velleman, Daniel J. [How To Prove It: A Structured Approach, 2nd
Edition. Cambridge University Press,
2006.](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/how-prove-it-structured-approach-2nd-edition?format=PB)

Course Structure and Expectations
---------------------------------

It is important that you come to class prepared for the topic for that
day. You should read through the book and lecture notes to have some
familiarity with the concepts that will be covered. There will also be
reading quizzes based on the material from the previous class as well as
basic understanding of the new topics for the day. Coming to class
prepared will allow you to better understand the discussion in class and
ask questions to help clear up any misunderstandings you may have. There
will be a series of homework assignments that will allow you to practice
the skills presented in lecture.

There will be periodic in-class reading quizzes, homework assignments,
four midterm exams and one final exam.

### Grades

Your overall grade for the course will be determined as follows:

-   Reading quizzes: 10%
-   Homework assignments: 15%
-   Exams: 75% (15% each)

Grades are assigned on a 100-point scale:

> | Numeric Range | Letter Grade |
> |---------------|--------------|
> | 90-100        | A (4.0)      |
> | 85-90         | B+ (3.5)     |
> | 80-85         | B (3.0)      |
> | 75-80         | C+ (2.5)     |
> | 70-75         | C (2.0)      |
> | 60-70         | D (1.0)      |
> | 0-60          | F (0.0)      |
>

### Course website

Please check the [course web page](index.html), regularly for important
announcements.

### Exams

**No make-up exams or quizzes will be given without approval of the
instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or illness
is provided.** There will be 4 midterm exams and a final. Students that choose to take the final may replace their lowest mid-term exam score with their score on the final exam.

### Reading Assignments and Quizzes

Reading assignments are posted on the [lecture
schedule](lecture/index.html). I expect you to do the reading **before**
class. Class time will be for asking questions about parts of the
reading you did not understand to your satisfaction.

There will be periodic quizzes based on the reading assignment and previous
class material. The quizzes will be administered at the **beginning** of
class, thus it is important to be prompt for class. The quizzes are
designed to lead into brief discussions of the class period\'s topic,
such that the majority of the time can focus on practice problems given
in class.

### Homework assignments

Homework problems will be posted for each class period. Problems from
the prior week will be collected on Monday at the **beginning** of
class. Late assignments will be marked down 20% per day late. **No credit will be given for assignments that are more than three (3) days late.**

### Academic Integrity

York College’s mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

The following policy pertains to all graded work in this course:

> All graded (individual) assignments are to be completed individually. I encourage you to discuss high level concepts with other students, but any work you submit **must be yours alone**.
>
> Direct copying of solutions or work from other students, web sites, or other sources **is absolutely forbidden under any circumstances**.
>
> Any sources (books, websites, articles, fellow students, etc.), except for the course textbook and lecture notes, that you consult in completing an assignment **must be properly acknowledged**. In general, I strongly discourage you from using any resource not explicitly listed in the course syllabus or on the course web page but rather asking the instructor for assistance.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the faculty member must inform the student in writing and then has ten business days from that written notification to the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic dishonesty will be kept on file in the student’s permanent record. If the academic dishonesty is the student’s first offense, the faculty member will have the discretion to decide on a suitable sanction up to a grade of 0 for the course. Students are not permitted to withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty.

### Attendance

Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes and read the appropriate text material prior to class. If you must miss a class, it is your responsibility to notify the professor prior to class. Students are responsible for all material covered in class.

You may work ahead and submit any assignments **early**, but you **must not** fall behind. Class time is intended to be used for working on practice problems and answering questions about the reading and assignments. You are responsible for keeping up with the reading assignments as described in the schedule.

### Professionalism

I expect you to conduct yourself as a professional in this course. Professionalism includes:

-   Respect for and courteous interaction with peers, faculty and facilities;
-   Integrity, which includes at its core honesty, responsibility and accountability for one’s own actions;
-   Sensitivity and appreciation for diverse cultures, backgrounds, and life experiences;
-   Constructive evaluation, which means that criticism is offered and accepted in a productive manner;
-   Self-reflection and identification of one’s own strengths and weaknesses;
-   Responsibility for one’s own education and learning;
-   An attitude that fosters professional behavior in colleagues and peers;
-   Punctuality at meetings and class sessions;
-   Attentive behavior during class sessions, avoiding personal or social use of cell phones, laptops, or other electronic devices;
-   Acknowledgement of the Kinsley Engineering Center as a professional workplace, and treatment of this facility as a business or office space, not as an informal space.

I reserve the right to enforce this code through the York College Code of Student Conduct.

### Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDA’s, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.

### Disability Support Services

If you had an IEP or 504 plan in high school or if you have a disability or health condition that impacts you in the classroom, please contact Linda Miller, Director of Disability Support Services, at 815-1785 or <lmille18@ycp.edu> to discuss obtaining the accommodations for which you may be eligible. If you already have an accommodation memo and wish to access your accommodations in this class, please see me confidentially to discuss.
